<h2>The 3 Body Problem</h2>
        <p>
            The three-body problem is famous for being an unsolved problem in physics and classical mechanics. It has
            no "closed form" solution, or in other words, there is no equation that can predict where any one of the three
            bodys will be, unlike a two body problem, like the Earth and Sun. Instead, the result is eventual chaos, and in
            the case of this simulation, the planets fly off the edge of the screen pretty quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Notice how changing the numbers even slightly greatly impacts the planets tragectories. This is primarily why the problem
            is so difficult, it's very hard to make accurate predictions.

            The default values were the values that for my testing, made the planets stay on the screen for as 
            long as possible, see if you can beat it!

<p>  * The Earth and Sun are not actually a two body problem, however the force of attraction from other celestial
            bodies is relatively low, resulting in a fairly stable and predictable orbit.
